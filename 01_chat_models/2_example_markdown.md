1. Divide 91 by 9.
   \[ 91 \div 9 \approx 10.1111\ldots \]

So, the quotient is approximately \( 10.1111 \ldots \) or \( 10 \) with a remainder.

To check the remainder:
\[ 91 - (9 \times 10) = 91 - 90 = 1 \]

Therefore, \( 91 \div 9 = 10 \) with a remainder of 1.

In decimal form, it is approximately \( 10.1111 \) (repeating).

In mixed number form, it is \( 10 \frac{1}{9} \).
Answer from AI: To solve \( 91 \div 9 \):

1. Determine how many times 9 fits into 91 without exceeding it.

   - \( 9 \times 10 = 90 \) (which is the closest multiple of 9 that is less than or equal to 91).

2. Subtract this product from 91 to find the remainder:
   \[
   91 - 90 = 1
   \]

3. Write the quotient and the remainder:
   \[
   91 \div 9 = 10 \text{ R } 1 \text{ or } 10 \frac{1}{9}
   \]

So, \( 91 \div 9 = 10 \frac{1}{9} \) or approximately 10.11 when expressed as a decimal.
